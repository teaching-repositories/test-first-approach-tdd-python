# Test First Approach TDD Python

This repository contains code examples and tutorials for learning test-driven development (TDD) with Python. 

## Tutorials

The repository includes the following tutorials:

- [TDD with Python](tutorials/tdd-python.md) - A comprehensive tutorial that teaches the concepts and workflow of test-driven development by building a real-world Python project using TDD principles.

## Code Examples

Code examples to support the tutorials are provided in the `code` directory.

The code illustrates core TDD concepts like:

- Writing tests with unittest before implementation code
- Using assert methods to test behavior
- Refactoring code without changing behavior 
- Leveraging test failures to drive development

## Getting Started 

To follow along with the tutorials:

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed 
3. Run `python -m unittest` in the root directory to execute example tests
4. Follow the tutorials in order for an in-depth TDD learning experience

## Contributions

Contributions and improvements are welcome! Open an issue or pull request to suggest fixes or additions to the tutorials and code examples.
